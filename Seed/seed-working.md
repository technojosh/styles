# Seed messaging, personality, and brand themes

Context for this document: after hearing your thoughts and comments, I will be using this document to create a basic style guide and brand voice guidelines-- some “how to write/talk/think like Seed” documentation for anyone who needs to learn about the brand or internalize brand positioning in order to write.


Suggestion for working mission/vision: Seed helps small businesses grow and thrive by giving them tools to make their finances easy to manage, so they can focus on building their big ideas.

If Seed had a personality, it would be: helpful, efficient, supportive, knowledgeable. Friendly, but stays out of the way unless called upon. An enthusiastic and nurturing (but lowkey) fan.

The problem we’re solving

There’s no easy, simple way to do small business banking. People who are trying to get businesses off the ground still have to do things like go into a bank branch to open an account, or figure out their own expense tracking. Handling finances for a business that is growing or just starting out is a lot of work, worry, hassle, and uncertainty. We knew we could make something better, that not only unifies banking and basic accounting, but is easy to use, reasonably priced, and totally online. 


Messaging/brand themes 

We’re passionate about supporting small business-- One thing I noticed a lot in researching Seed was the sense that someone’s bank should “get out of their way” and be kind of invisible. While I very much agree that that’s true, I think that’s achieved mostly through strategy (how/when you deploy content and messaging) rather than the messaging itself. Brian and Ryan are obviously passionate about helping people start businesses and make their dreams real. That passion should be readily visible to those who seek it out. It sounds corny, but we want clients to get the sense that we truly believe in them and want them to succeed-- because we do. “We want our clients to feel like we are a partner, not a vendor. That is an uncommon relationship to have with a bank and one that is traditionally only possible with credit unions or some community banks. If they trust our voice, our sincerity, and our sense of community with them, I think that'll go a long way to establishing ourselves as a true partner.”

Sample sentences: We’re honored to work with clients who are building towards their dreams, their goals, or something that’s going to make things better. We love to see how our clients grow, succeed, and make change. We’re rooting for you, and we know that with tools that just work beautifully, you get more time to make change in your corner of the world. 

Growth, nurture, and possibility-- You chose “Seed” for a reason, and I think in the beginning it had more to do with startups, but it is still very apt for the focus on small business. The word “seed” evokes these concepts: youth and growth, protecting and caring for something, and the potential of something small to turn into something big. Obviously I do not suggest getting punny or putting too fine a point on it, but these seed-related concepts should be subtly woven into your language with regularity. They will also be useful for thinking of taglines and advertising, where clever allusions can be a little more obvious. 
Sample sentences: We help you grow beautifully. For small businesses with big dreams. 

We got this-- Yeah, we love you and stuff, but we’re also hustlers who know our way around this shit and you’re gonna be fine if you stick with us. That, but in a nice way. I probably don’t need to explain why an air of authority and confidence is necessary in banking. The key is to have that air of authority when speaking about financial matters and your own business, but balance that with empathy and understanding, because you are also talking (whether implicitly or explicitly) about someone else’s business. This is going to be useful when talking about support and fraud protection.
Sample sentences: We’ve got your back, so you can grow. We know business finances can be confusing, time consuming, or even a hurdle to starting your business in the first place. That’s why we’re creating tools to take the confusion out of not just banking, but expense tracking, invoicing, accounting, and more. We’ll help you make sense of it all, and when you can’t, our team is here to talk you through.

We’re a small business too-- This messaging is most appropriate for discussions about the company/team. We are building this as we are also running a small business. There’s the standard messaging about how we’re making the tools we want to see in the world/we get how small businesses operate, but there’s also the more subtle idea that small businesses can and should support one another, that their size is also a strength. For this stage in the company, we’re very much a part of the community we serve, which gives us genuine opportunity to engage from a place of familiarity.
Sample sentences: We’re a small business too. We know firsthand the challenges and joys of helping something grow, and we believe that small businesses can be resources for one another. We’re building the tools we want to use as we make our ideas into a reality. We’re here to help you do the same.


Audience

As we discussed, words like “entrepreneurs”, “makers”, and “innovators” all feel sort of off. Briefly, I think the reasons that (to me) they feel off are illuminating:
They are narrow. They all refer to a really specific type of business-- one that is creating something new. If someone is starting their own dry cleaning business, they’re not really blazing a trail, but they’re absolutely just as deserving of a good banking relationship as a startup. 
They are buzzwordy and thus meaningless. 
They are culturally coded to imply “young” or “tech-native”. While these things may indeed describe our likely initial clients, they are not the defining traits of our clients. It’s exclusive language, and I get the sense Seed does not want to feel exclusive. Even if we might define someone as a “maker” or “innovator”, if they don’t fit a very specific demographic, they’re not likely to identify themselves that way--in fact, they may not stake their identity on their professional pursuits at all, and that’s okay (maybe even healthy!).

Instead, here are some things that are very likely to describe our target clients:

They are building and nurturing something they deeply care about.
They spend a lot of time and mental energy thinking, worrying, planning, and trying to make decisions about their venture.
They are emotionally invested in what they are doing.
They also have lives that they are trying to live.
Their time is best spent growing and managing their business.
They want to use the best products and services to help their business.
They want to feel like their vendors are true partners that have their best interests in mind.
The life of a business owner can be isolating and personally challenging, so feeling part of a community that is helpful and supportive is important.

Honestly, it isn’t flashy or sexy, but I think the audience you’re looking for are most likely to identify as… small business owners/people. I see that you are trying to answer the question of “Banking for ___________” with something other than that, but actually, as I’ve set out in this document “small business” as a phrase does a pretty good job of emotionally encompassing all the worry, hard work, optimism, dreams, etc. So I don’t think you should try to find a synonym or a snappier way of putting it. Embrace it!
