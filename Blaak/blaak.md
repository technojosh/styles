# Blaak messaging and mission

## Background

### Suggestion for working mission/vision:

**We want to make investing easy, welcoming, and affordable for anyone-- whether they have a few hundred dollars or a few million. We think the best way to honor the trust our clients place in us is to create a structure where we win when they win.**
---------------

### If Blaak had a personality, it would be:
welcoming, driven, knowledgeable

## Messaging
*Note: By framing the problem as a story of your experience, you build in an emotional component-- the goal here is to demonstrate why this problem was important enough to you to strike out on your own. You display your personality and values as founders while highlighting the problem you are trying to solve.*

### The problem we’re solving

People who’ve never managed a portfolio can feel understandably daunted when it comes to trying to invest. They can entrust their money to an advisor to manage, but that can be intimidating and expensive. They invest on their own, but studies show that on average they underperform when they go it alone. There’s a large market of people who want to invest and not worry about it (ie automate), and even more who didn’t realize that smaller investments can be possible and profitable.

- As financial advisors for a multinational corporate bank, we saw firsthand that the investment industry hasn’t budged in decades in terms of either technology or customer experience. The language of finance is intentionally hard to understand, and the fees, paperwork, and procedures are onerous--even for clients with experience investing. Most importantly, we saw that our interests as advisors were more aligned with corporate quotas and sales targets than with building strong portfolios for our clients. 

- There’s a reason that people who don’t have tens of thousands of dollars feel that investing isn’t available to them: when we were at the corporate bank we worked for, we literally did not receive commission on accounts below $50k.

- Younger consumers who have money to invest are more likely to be mistrustful of corporate banking and financial advisers. They’re also more likely to be comfortable with a more automated approach.

- By eliminating overhead and streamlining processes, we can charge much less in management fees, while offering competitive portfolio management and great service. 

### Audience
- For people who have never invested before, our goal is to show them that they can invest and make money. To them, we need to sell the general idea of investing.
- For people who are seasoned investors, our goal is to differentiate ourselves from similar services. To them, we showcase our lower fees, knowledge of the industry, and ease of use.

### Differentiators
- **Demographics**: for people who are shopping for an investment service, we’re going to have the lowest fees and the most straightforward service. For people who’ve never invested before, we’re going to show them it’s possible and beneficial.
- **Personal service**: we’ll be hiring people like us who have financial advisement expertise but who are unhappy with trying to upsell at every turn
- **Messaging**: other investment tech (“robo-advisors”) is still geared toward those who understand investing and are already educated about the industry. For those who are new to investing, don’t think it’s a possibility for them, or have only a small amount to invest, our messaging will invite them in and show them why it’s possible and profitable for them. For experienced investors and higher value clients, our messaging will highlight our low fees and personalized service.
- **Ease of money movement**: Clients will have much better access to their money than with other services.

*Note: IMO this is currently the weakest part of the messaging. For someone who's familiar with the players already in the space, we'll need to create some messaging tailored specifically at why we're preferable to each of our competitors.*
