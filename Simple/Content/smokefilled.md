## What is it?

When we have a rad idea about a marketing project we'd like to do, there's a lot of planning to do! Firstly, we need to draw out the timeline: when do we submit to TBBK, when do we want to publish, what channels we might use, expected ROI, etc. (There will be guidelines for this linked here soon.jpg!)

Once we've got the idea and the timeline, it's time for the Smoke-Filled Room. That's where we sit around and navel-gaze to get in sync with our overall messaging and our big-picture goals with this project. 

## Why?

If all our content creators, and those responsible for editing and disseminating that content are in the room when we have the discussions about overall premise, it smooths out the process. Each person thinking about communicating from their specific platform will add new ideas for the conversations, and there will be fewer big-picture questions during the editing process.

## How?

This is an ever-evolving process, but:

#### **Part 1.**
- Once you've written your basic premise with all the tactical details (and gotten the overall themes and premise approved), it's time to think about the content. 
- Call a Smoke-Filled-Room. Cast a broad net for the attendees. For example, even if you think we might not email customers about this, invite your email writer anyway. She can still think about it from that point of view, and contribute to the discussion.
- At the very least, you should invite a representative from:
	- Content
	- Social
	- PR/Comms
	- Brand 
	- Lifecycle
	- You may want to consider inviting Creative or CR too. Invite the person who will actually be writing or creating material--they will know best which questions to ask.
- Make a Draper ticket
- Make sure everyone has access to the tactical document (and put it in the ticket!)

#### **Part 2.**
In your meeting, discuss these questions. You've got a half hour to explore these satisfyingly, but not too deeply. Keep it short, and if it doesn't apply, skip it-- but make sure you take a sec to consider whether it *could* apply.

1. **What do we want customers to do/get out of this? What are our business goals?** (These questions are probably already answered in your tactical document.) 
2. **What are we asking them to do--what is the call to action?** (Also probably in your tactical document.)
3. **How do we want readers/customers to feel when they first see communications about this?** 
	- What do you want their superficial feelings to be? (e.g. "I'm intrigued" or "I want to learn more about this.") 
	- What do we want their secret feels to be? (e.g. "My bank really cares about me." or "This will help me stop worrying and get back on track.")
4. **How are we framing this?**
	- What are the main ideas?
	- What are specific words and phrases we want to use?
	- What ideas do we want to avoid (e.g. "Your spending tells a story, but not 'your spending tells YOUR story', because a person is not represented by their bank account.")
	- What are specific words and phrases we might want to avoid?
5. **What would be the best reaction?**
	- What would we love press to say about this thing (pretend it's a thing worth press-ing about if it's not)?
	- What would we love customers to say about it? Privately and on the innernets (blogs, social media)?
	- What would we love potential customers to say about it?
	- What would we love others in our industry to say about it?
6. **Bonusland: do we already have copy or design ideas? What else came out of this discussion?**

#### **Part 3.**
Update the ticket with your findings!
