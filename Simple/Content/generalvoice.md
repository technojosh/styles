## Our voice

Our overall voice is that of a friendly person who knows about finance. We call this, lovingly

**THE INFORMED FRIEND.**

You will hear this phrase again.

## How we talk about ourselves

<b>On the marketing website</b>, we’re not shy about talking about “we” or “us.” We help you understand your spending habits. One of our philosophies at Simple is that we have a point of view. That means we end up referring to ourselves a lot. References to ourselves should always either convey a value or belief, or talk about us in relation to the user/customer. Likewise, speech is directed at “you”, the customer. Never “customers” or “users”; “you”.

<b>In-app copy</b> should actually shy away from “we” and “us.” This is very marketing-y speak, so in-app copy should be very user-centric and be focused on action and brevity.

# Writing For...

## The Simple Blog

When you write for the Simple blog, you're writing to our customers. So when you talk about our customers, use the pronoun "you". When you refer to the team at Simple, use "we". Of course, you are writing the blog post as yourself, so it's cool to throw an "I" or two in there, but use sparingly. The information in your blog posts should be stuff that an enthusiastic Simple customer would care about. Of course, you are also secondarily writing for press, tech observers, and the competition. As such, you should assume only basic familiarity with Simple's features. The tone should be friendly, with a slight flavor of marketing copy. Not too much; think, like, a glass of water with a slice of cucumber in it. That much marketing flava.

## The Simple Engineering Blog (Quantitative Steezing)

When you write for Quantitative Steezing, you're speaking to an audience of your peers in the tech/fintech world. When you refer to our customers, use "they". When you refer to our team, use "we" or "us". You may also use "I", sparingly. You should assume basic familiarity with the tools and languages that you reference, but you should also write with an eye on your post appealing to as wide a group of your audience as possible. Because we are enthusiastically agnostic to languages or tool sets, we want to make our posts subtly evangelize that spirit. When you write for QS, you are representing our engineering culture as much as you are the specific topic you're discussing.

## Simple.com

The primary audience of simple.com is our future customers. Secondarily, it's current customers, press, competitors, and everyone who might ever give a shit about Simple. This language is, like that of our general tone, that of a banking-nerd friend who is kind and a little bit funny.

## Twitter

### Your personal twitter, tweeting about Simple.
If you want to speak to customers/fans on Twitter about Simple, please make sure your bio notes that you are a Simple employee. However, keep in mind: if you identify yourself as a Simple employee <b>YOU ARE REPRESENTING THE COMPANY WHEN YOU TWEET</b>. Yes, even if you say "my views are my own." That does not protect you. Think of all the jerks out there who have that in their profile: you still associate them with their companies. It sucks, but it's unfortunately true. Sooo... you may not troll or harass any Twitter user (they are, of course, more likely to be/know a customer the more time goes on). Since you are an adult, you know what constitutes "going too far", and you should, uh, not. You may not be too terribly vocal about the suckitude of other banks/tech companies.

### @Simple
@Simple's voice is primarily directed toward current customers, but with a heavy flavor of PR (as opposed to cucumber water, think Crystal Light). That means that while the voice is light, funny, personal, and almost imperceptibly trolly, it's primarily concerned with getting shit done for our customers without rockin' too many boats.
