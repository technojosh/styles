## Banner and sidebar

### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Curious:** "Hm, what's going on with this?"| **Informed:** "I feel up to speed."|
| **Alarmed:** "Uh oh I see red text!"| **Prepared:** "I understand what's happening."|

### Our copy should focus on:
Above all else, it should be informative. It should not attempt to be outwardly defensive or apologetic. This is space for information.

#### Other things to consider:
- Keep it short. The banner text should be a summary of the issue. The sidebar text can go into detail but should only report the necessary information.
- Although it may be urgent or important, steer clear of inflammatory language for this.

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
- **Calm:** This situation is under control.
- **Informed:** This is all the information we have. We're making sure you're abreast of the situation. We're setting expectations.
- **Availability:** We're here to answer questions and help if necessary.
- **Slight detatchment:** this is just the facts. We can report the facts empathetically, but the place for apologies (if necessary) and other editorializing is in the messaging customers will receive.
- **Helpfulness:** If applicable, tell the customer what actions they could take.

### Important words or phrases to use:
- (depends on the situation)
