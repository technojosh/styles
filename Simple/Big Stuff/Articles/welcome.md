## Welcome flow

### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Confused:** "How the heck do I use Simple?"| **Calm:** "All my questions will be answered."|
| **Put-upon:** "Man switching all my stuff over is going to be a huge hassle."| **Confident:** "I got this."|
| **Excited, impatient:** "Yesss I can't wait until I get my card!"| **Reinforced:** "I will continue to feel this way until I get my card!"|
| **Unsure:** "Hm, I don't really know if this is going to be useful to me."| **Reinforced:** "I will give Simple a fair shot!"|

### Our copy should focus on:
We should subtly focus on the confused and the unsure, with enough excitement to connect with the excited, but not enough to put off the put-upon :)

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
- **Confident leadership:** We know the best way to lead people through the activation journey.
- **Enthusiasm, gratitude:** We are truly excited and thankful to have them as a customer, and it imbues everything we say.
- **Ease:** This process is not difficult and is totally worth it.
- **Anticipation:** This is going to be great!

#### Other things to consider:
- Keep it short and punchy! This is customer-facing copy that is going to be a little more marketing-y than usual--we are still selling Simple to many of the users who will be seeing it.
- Keep playing up the excitement and talking about the future. We're going to keep them engaged with us while we wait for their card and funding to arrive.
- Keep in mind that this will work in tandem with the activation emails.
- Set expectations for timelines.

### Important words or phrases to use:
- "You" - focus on the customer and the benefits they will get from taking each step

### **Example Copy**
>Have you gotten your card yet? It should have arrived 7-10 business days after you were approved. If you have, go grab it and activate it now! Spending with Simple is fun, especially when you've budgeted in advance.
