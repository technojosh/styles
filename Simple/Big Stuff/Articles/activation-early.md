## Activation email - early

### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Excited:** "I'm glad my new bank is following up with me."| **Reinforced:** "They're glad to have me as a customer."|
| **Neutral:** "Oh yeah, Simple."| **Aware:** "I'm thinking more often about the new account I have."|
| **Disengaged:** "I'm not really paying attention to the new account I have."| **Aware:** "Ah yes, I have a Simple account."|

### Our copy should focus on:
We should focus on the neutral person, while not alienating either of the others. In the early stages, an activation email should reinforce the reasons they decided to get an account, and introduce them more personally to the kind of company we're going to be. Short and sweet, it should do all of these things in a small space.

After these initial emails, they'll be segmented out by activity level.

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
- **Excitement, warmth, welcoming, gratitude:** We're truly happy to have them as a customer.
- **Momentum:** This is going to be great, and we want you to keep thinking about Simple.
- **Personality, humor, informality:** This is their introduction to our personality, they should be able to feel it shine through.
- **Directness:** There will be certain actions we want them to take, and those should be very clear.
- **Support:** We're here for them.

### Important words or phrases to use:
- "Welcome!" - obvs
- "account" - we're still reinforcing what we are.
