## In danger and idle - activation

### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Disengaged:** "I'm not thinking about Simple that much."| **Aware:** "Oh yeah, I have a Simple account."|
| **Unconvinced:** "I don't really see the value here."| **Open:** "Maybe this will be useful after all."|

### Our copy should focus on:
Both are equally difficult, but it's easier to win over the disengaged. The copy should be short and balanced, but not pleading.

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
- **We're still here!:** At this point, we are just reminding the reader that we exist.
- **Possibility:** There are still things to love about Simple and we want to highlight those things.
- **Acknowledgement:** We know they may not be engaged, and we can talk about why if appropriate, and address that issue.
- **Perscriptive:** Give them a concrete thing to do.

### Important words or phrases to use:
- (depends on specific email content)

### **Example Copy**
>Hi ,

>I’m Elena, and I work with new customers to make sure switching to Simple is an awesome experience. :)

>So, how’s it going so far? Is there any way I can help you start using Simple? Let me know and I’d be happy to help!

>To keep your info safe, please don’t email me any personal data, like card numbers, Social Security numbers, etc. However, in addition to Simple-related questions, I do appreciate pet photos, animated .gifs, and jokes. :)

>All the best,

>Elena

>PS, if you want to know what else you can do to get started, this page has some great info.
