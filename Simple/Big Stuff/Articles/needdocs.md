## Need docs

### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Annoyed:** "I thought this was supposed to be Simple..."| **Prepared:** "This won't be so bad/will be worth it."|
| **Undaunted:** "No prob, I really want Simple."| **Vindicated:** "This will be easy!"|
| **Hamstrung:** "Eff. I'm a fraudster and I don't have this."| **Deterred:** "Welp."|
| **Waning interest:** "Mang, I don't really want to go through all this hassle."| **Convinced:** "Okay, I will do this."|

### Our copy should focus on:
The copy should be pretty straightforward and a little bank-y-- we are asking them for personal documents. We should have a slight preference for language that implies that this is easy and worth it, as a defense against abandonment or dejection.

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
- **Ease:** This is an easy process, so of course it would be silly to leave now (heh.)!
- **Helpful:** Here's how you do this *totally easy* thing.
- **Anticipation:** The awesomeness of Simple is on the other side of you uploading this one easy thing.
- **Authority:** We need them to do this thing. We're asking them for more info, so we should sound official.

### Important words or phrases to use:
- "just" , "only", etc. - this is easy so don't leave pleasepleaseplease
- "You're almost there!" "One more quick thing" - anticipation
- "The best way to do this..." - dictating a course of action will make it more likely that the action is taken.

### **Example Copy**

>The easiest way to do this is to snap a picture of the whole  document (we need to see all four corners) with your phone—just remember to delete it from your phone after it’s uploaded to us. If you’re on a computer, you can reach this screen from your mobile app, too.
