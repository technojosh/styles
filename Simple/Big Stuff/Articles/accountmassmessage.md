## Account-related mass message to customers

### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Uneasy:** "Uh oh. Why is my bank sending me a message."| **Reassured:** "It's clear what they wanted to inform me."|
| **Neutral:** "What's this about?"| **Informed:** "This message lets me know what's up."|

### Our copy should focus on:
The tone should be geared to a more neutral reader, but its *content* and the organization of that content should address and eliminate unease as soon as possible.

#### Other things to consider:
- This message should be short and to the point. Remember that people will likely not be expecting this message, and it's likely to be informing them of an abnormality in their account. They've already had to open the app to read it. If you can, put a non-alarming summary of the issue in the subject.
- The language should be clinical without being overly technical. 
- Effusive emotion isn't going to serve us well here, but you should make sure there is empathetic language and wording as you type.
- Always offer a solution.
- Don't apologize unless an apology is merited. Use your best judgment about the severity of the impact. If you do include an apology, don't dwell on it, and don't repeat it unless we *really* fucked up.

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
- **Calm:** Whatever the news, we've got this under control (unless we don't)
- **Control, empowerment:** Here's what you can do to make this better. Also, your money is totally okay (unless it's not).
- **Availability:** "We're here to help!"
- **Empathy:** Sometimes we have to break tough news. We always remember that dealing with money is emotional.
- **Expertise:** Clear explanation of the problem and our solutions.

### Important words or phrases to use:
- "we can help" - conveys both openness to help and that we have a solution

#### Stuff not to say
- "error", "something went wrong" - inflammatory language won't help the message be better understood
- "we're super sorry!" - intensifiers will come off as false in this kind of official communication

### **Example Copy**
>**Subject: Direct deposit- 1 hour delay**

>Hi Jefferton,

>Just to let you know-- we are delayed about an hour in processing direct deposits today. We know you were expecting a transfer, so please don't worry! It's on its way. You should see your deposit by 8am Eastern. If you don't see it by then, of if you have any questions, please reply to this message to let us know. 

>Thanks for banking with us!

>-The Team at Simple

(note: this is not a scenario we'd necessarily inform customers about; it's simply meant as an example.)
