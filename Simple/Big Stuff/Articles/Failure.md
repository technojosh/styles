## Failure

### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Disappointed:** "Aw man, I really wanted an account."| **Understanding:** "I get why I can't have an account."|
| **Meh:** "Oh well."| **Meh:** "Meh."|
| **Outraged:** "THIS IS BULLSHIT!!"| **Understanding, resigned:** "Welp, this sucks but I'll live."|
| **Confused:** "Why would I be rejected?"| **Informed:** "I understand what might have happened."|

### Our copy should focus on:
The disappointed person. Strike a good balance between apologetic (only a little) and firm (it's very likely that this decision is final). This is one of the only times we might want to put a barrier between someone and the information they seek-- there are certain cases where the person will be able to reapply, but there's a lot of hoops for them to jump through. Outlining the hoops gives them a realistic view of that process, so if they're dedicated they can try, but if not, they'll accept the decision.

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
- **Slight dismay:** We're sorry (but not anguished.)
- **Firmness, authority:** Most likely, this decision can't be reversed. We should be up front about that.
- **Helpful:** We can point them in the right direction in the form of "common reasons" or steps to take to get their Chexsystems report.

### Important words or phrases to use:
- "Unable to offer you an account" - more precisely, don't say "rejected" or "denied"
- "We're sorry" - we're truly sorry (but not overly contrite) that we can't offer this person an account.

### **Example Copy**
>"Unfortunately, we are unable to open an account for you. Thank you so much for applying. If you have questions, please send an email to applications@simple.com. Keep in mind that, for your privacy, Simple is not informed of the reasons why your application was denied, but some common reasons for denial include..."

>"If you've gotten your ChexSystems report, and you've rectified any errors or past banking issues, we may be able to help you reapply for Simple. As a warning, it's often not possible to reapply, but we'd love to help you out if it is!..."
