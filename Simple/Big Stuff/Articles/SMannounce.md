## Social media - Broadcast

### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Mild interest:** "Oh neat, Simple did something."| **Satisfied:** "I'm glad I read that."|
| **Excitement:** "Yes! I love Simple. I'm clicking right away!"| **Justified:** "This reinforces my love for Simple."|
| **Jaded:** "This isn't about the thing I care about most."| **Pleasantly surprised:** "Well, I'm still glad I read about it."|

### Our copy should focus on:
The primary point of a social media broadcast post (ie, a post that is not a reply) is usually to get readers to click on something, or to start a conversation. Either way, you should write with someone who's excited in mind-- this conveys our brand personality. Don't be off-puttingly excited though, because that'll be a turn off to the mildly interested person. If it's bad news, just being straightforward is the way to go.

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
- **Excitement:** We're so pumped to be telling our audience about this. Unless it's bad news.
- **Open:** We'd love our audience to engage with us on this, whether they tweet at us or reply on Facebook or whatever.
- **Personable:** Whatever we say or do, humans are saying and doing that thing.

### Important words or phrases to use:
- "!" - if we're excited, exclaim!
- "New", "now", "finally", "today" - makes things feel current and timely
- "Hey!", "Hi!" - gets the reader's attention and feels personal.

#### Other things to consider:
- Don't use excessive slang, but it's okay to be a little cute on Twitter. Don't use a hashtag as a punchline.
- On Facebook, be a little more straightforward, but still warm. People won't get jokes or references there, but will respond well to slightly more emotive language.
- On G+, use slightly more formal language. Be personable still, but know that our G+ audience skews slightly more tech-minded, male, contrarian, and less likely to respond to effusive emotion.
- On Instagram, the important thing is the picture. Be personable-- most Instagram users follow mostly their friends and only a small handful of brands, so speech that is too marketing-y or slick will be jarring in their flow. Unlike Twitter, do use a hashtag as a punchline. You can't link from there, and users can't re-share easily, so just do whatever will be memorable.
