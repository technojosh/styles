## Policy updates

### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Mildly concerned, skeptical, looking for the catch:** "How are they going to screw me over now?"| **Relieved:** "I feel informed and calm."|
| **Unmoved:** "This is boring."| **Aware:** "I know that Simple sent a policy update."|
| **Interested:** "I'm curious about this policy."| **Informed:** "I understand what was updated and why."|

### Our copy should focus on:
Above all, clarity. If we update our policies, they're going to be dense legalese, and very long and wordy. Our job is to make clear what changes were made.

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
- **Openness:** We're showing you what we've got.
- **Clarity:** This is easy to understand.
- **Solidarity:** We're on your side with our policies, and we'll always explain what's going on.

### Important words or phrases to use:
- (dependent on content)

### **Example Copy**
>Hi ,

>We’re required to remind you, on an annual basis, about our privacy policy. It’s also a good idea in general to review this from time to time. Since Simple is the company which provides you with access to your funds, and our partner bank, The Bancorp Bank, holds your funds in an FDIC-insured account, we’re sharing our privacy policy as well as Bancorp’s.

>Simple’s privacy policy is here. We’ve made some changes this year, so please make sure to take a look. The Bancorp Bank’s privacy policy is here.

>Here's what's new this year:

>-In order to check new customers' identities when they sign up for Simple, we use the personal information they provide to verify and qualify them for an account, through third-party tools.
-We collect data about clicks, page opens, and other website usage, using third-party tracking tools.
-We've pluralized "financial institution", as we're now working with new partners including BBVA Compass and Fiserv.
-Added some extra wording about our existing practices so the wording will comply with certain state-specific requirements
