## Knowledge Base

### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Investigative:** "I want to know every detail about this."| **Informed:** "I feel confident in my knowledge of this feature/issue."|
| **Confused:** "How do I do this thing?"| **Prepared:** "I understand how this works."|

### Our copy should focus on:
The KB is public, but it's also very densely filled with information. The investigative person should be our guide here, and we should assume they're not a customer. Basically, include everything a current customer might want to know, but explain it in the language of a prospective customer.

#### Some other things to consider:
- Use this space to discuss the most relevant parts of a topic first.
- Set the reader's expectations. Let them know what it's going to be like when they take the action they're taking.

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
- **Clarity:** We're explaining complex concepts. The reader may not be familiar with our product, with banking, or with technology. 
- **Authority:** This is your chance to write an essay about this topic. Include all the details.
- **Informative:** Numbers and charts go here. Keep in mind that ideally this will be used instead of CR contact.
- **Personable:** This is a lot of information, but that doesn't mean we can't convey our brand personality.
- **Empathy:** We have a chance to set ourselves apart always, by acknowledging with our tone that money is important and emotional. We also have a chance to remove guilting language from discussions of difficult topics like overdrafting.

### Important words or phrases to use:
- (depends on the article)

### **Example Copy**
> Photo Check Deposit is one of the coolest features in our mobile app. You can deposit a check or money order simply by endorsing it and taking a clear photo. We use a specialized scanning service to read the crucial information on the check and create a legal copy of it.

>You can find the check deposit button in the navigation drawer of the Android app (it's labeled "Deposit Check"), or in the Move Money tab of the iOS app (in the bottom right corner). Once you tap that button, you'll be guided through the process of submitting a check for review. After the check is submitted, we'll review it and send you a support message to confirm that it's been accepted, or explain any issues that are preventing us from accepting the deposit.
