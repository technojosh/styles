## Thought leadership

### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Interested:** "I'd love to know how Simple thinks about/does this thing."| **Impressed:** "That's really cool/thoughtful."|

### Our copy should focus on:
The main audience for thought leadership posts is peers in our industry. We should therefore talk as though the reader is familiar with the tools, environments, vocabulary, resources, trends, concepts, etc. we are discussing, but not very familiar with Simple's product, culture, or concept.

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
- **Authority:** We know our shit.
- **Thoughtfulness:** We've looked at this problem or idea in an interesting and new way.
- **Openness:** We welcome feedback and collaboration.
- **Humility:** We're awesome, but we respect our peers and we're grateful for the work others in our field have done.

### Important words or phrases to use:
- (depends on the subject matter)

### **Example Copy**
>"Open source software is a part of our DNA here at Simple. Our product is realized because we stand on the shoulders of giants who came before us. As an organization we believe it’s vital to not just be a consumer of the open source communities' work, but also to be active contributors to it. In our iOS app we use AFNetworking and were able to help develop the original SSL Pinning Feature. Over the last year we also started using CocoaPods in our build process. It was the perfect mechanism to release some of the reusable components we’ve developed in house."
