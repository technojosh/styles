### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Interested:** "I love to know what's going on with Simple!"| **Satisfied:** "That's great!"|

### Our copy should focus on:
Almost anyone who reads news about Simple, the company, is going to be interested and engaged.

#### Some things to consider:
The key to differentiating the interest is *why* they're interested. There's a few reasons:
- They're a customer who's a fan of us, and/or who sees company news as an indicator of our overall health.
- They're a member of the press who is seeing if there's a story in our news.
- They're someone in the finance/tech/fintech world who wants to see what we're up to so they can compare with their work.

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
- **Stability:** Simple is doing great things and making smart moves.
- **Leadership:** We are on the forefront of our industry, and we would like to help set the tone for everyone else.
- **Excitement:** We are really excited about our own work. Our genuine love for what we do shines through in our writing.

### Important words or phrases to use:
- (dependent on the situation)
