## Success - Welcome

### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Mild interest, neutral:** "Oh hey, my Simple account was approved."| **Excited:** "This is going to be great!"|
| **Excited:** "YAY! Time to get a new bank!"| **MOAR EXCITED:** "YASSS I AM GOING TO LOVE THIS"|

### Our copy should focus on:
The mildly interested person. We want to gently get them excited about what's to come for them so they're more likely to be active.

#### Other considerations
- There's not a lot the customer can do with their account at this point. They're vulnerable to forgetting about us and getting bored.
- They're not going to have much familiarity with the product yet, so it's good to focus on encouraging an emotional connection with Simple.
- While they may not have familiarity with the product, we can still reinforce the promises of helping them control their finances, save more, etc.

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
- **Excitement:** We are really pumped to have a new customer! 
- **Eagerness for next steps:** Don't lose interest! Here's the things you can do while you wait.
- **Openness:** We're excited and here to help. We want the customer to stay engaged.

### Important words or phrases to use:
- "Welcome" - duh.
- "you can..." - there's not a lot they can do. Be prescriptive.
- "We" - reinforces the formation of a relationship and underscores that people built this.

### **Example Copy**
> Congratulations!

>You’re now a Simple customer! We’re so happy to have you. Your card should arrive in 7-10 business days. In the meantime, sign in to see what you’ll be able to do with your new account. 

>							(Woo! Come on in!)
