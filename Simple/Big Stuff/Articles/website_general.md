## Website- General

### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Curious:** "What the heck is this Simple thing?"| **Informed:** "All my questions will be answered."|

### Our copy should focus on:
Pretty much the main thrust of our website is to inform the curious. The challenge is in the amount of information: some people only need basic facts, some people want to learn every tiny detail. Therefore, copy should work in harmony with design to make sure that the info meets needs anywhere on that spectrum.

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
- **Welcoming:** We are truly glad this person is visiting our website. We're not afraid to act that way.
- **Easy:** This product is going to be easy to use, and make your financial life easier.
- **Informal:** We're relatable. We want people to know that we're going to speak to them honestly and straightforwardly.
- **Knowledgeable, confident:** We know our stuff! We're the informed friend. 

### Important words or phrases to use:
- "You" - our website should be like a good real estate website-- you should be able to imagine yourself in this new world where you bank with Simple. "You" puts the focus on the reader, constantly.
- "Save" - this is a thing people want to do.
- "banking" - differentiates Simple from Mint and the like.

### **Example Copy**
> "Customer service isn't an afterthought, it's at the core of everything we do. Simple gives you tools to help yourself, while still making sure knowledgeable, friendly people are there to help when you need them. No pitfalls, no phone menus, no frustration."
