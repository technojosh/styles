## Apology
*(Sorry you're here, friend. I hope this helps. - Ed.)*

### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Angry, hurt:** "Simple really upset me."| **Somewhat comforted:** "I believe that they are sorry and have plans to fix things."|
| **Popcorn dot gif:** "I love a good tech apology post."| **Satisfied:** "That was a genuine and effective apology."|
| **Curious:** "I'm upset, but I *really* want to know what happened."| **Informed:** "I feel like my questions were answered."|

### Our copy should focus on:
We should be tunnel-vision, laser-focused on customers who were wronged. An apology post should speak only to the people who were wronged, while being acutely aware that others will be listening intently, and therefore subtly folding in the messages we need them to hear.

#### Some things to consider:
- Here's who will be reading your apology post, and what they'll be reading for:
	- **Customers:** They want to know first and foremost that their money and information are safe. Then, that you're sorry, and that you are very aware of what they went through. They want to know what happened, in clear terms. What you're going to do to prevent things like this from happening in the future, what you plan to do to rectify this mistake, and what this means for the overall health of the company.
	- **Industry peers:** They want to know what went wrong from a technical perspective. They are interested in the company narrative, the company's overall health, and the way the company's values are reflected in the apology. Tech apology blog posts are almost a spectator event at this point.
	- **Press:** Press is interested in the company narrative as well. They will be looking for what you're *not* saying, and sniffing for signs of weakness. They want to know what happened to the extent that that story will be interesting to their readers. 
- Your apology post is your chance to set the narrative from the company's perspective. You will be telling "our side" of the story, and framing it in the way that is most advantageous for us. Depending on the situation, that could mean a lot of things, but for Simple's purposes, the most advantageous framing is almost *always* telling as much of the truth as possible; clearly, humbly, and straightforwardly.
- It's important to be genuinely and humbly sorry, but not self-flagellating or wallowing in guilt. There is strength in vulnerability, in admitting wrongs. There's no need to further grovel, it will look false and weak in a moment where we need to look resolute.
- Your apology post isn't going to fix anything or regain customers' trust. Keep in mind that it's a small but important part of a larger effort to show our customers that we have improved.

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
*Note: all of these could be followed by "unless that's not true in this case"*
- **Contrition:** We are truly and genuinely sorry.
- **Stability:** We've recovered from this incident enough to write an apology about it.
- **Empathy, awareness:** We've internalized and felt badly about the ways this incident has affected our customers.
- **Desire to inform:** We truly want to explain, as much as possible, what happened, why, and how.
- **We've learned:** We have taken things away from this experience and made decisions about how to be better in the future.
- **Scope and severity:** It's important to note how many customers were affected, and with what severity. 

### Important words or phrases to use:
- "I/we am/are (deeply, truly, genuinely, etc.) sorry." - Do not sugarcoat or give a non-apology. Don't say "we're sorry if you were offended" or "I'm sorry if I hurt you." Just say "I am sorry," in no uncertain terms.
- "You" - this is for the customers. We're talking to them.

### **Example Copy**
>"Of all the things I want to tell you, this is most important: I am deeply sorry. I have spent the past week working alongside our Customer Relations team, answering your questions and hearing your frustrations. I know there is nothing I can say that will fix the damage, and I know a few of you still face issues. We let you down. We’re doing everything we can to help make things right.

>By way of explanation, I’d like to tell you about the major project we completed, why we did it, and why this disruption is very unlikely to happen again."
