## Invite/IDV reminder

### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Disengaged:** "I don't really care about this."| **Curious:** "I'll check Simple out."|
| **Lazy:** "I'll do this later."| **Empowered:** "There's nothing stopping me from doing this right now."|

### Our copy should focus on:
The lazy person is more likely to convert eventually, but a slight flavor of re-convincing is good too.

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
- **Still here!:** Remember us? We still want you to be a customer.
- **Personality:** We're a brand you'll enjoy engaging with.
- **Urgency:** Go redeem your invite now!

### Important words or phrases to use:
- "Now", "today", etc. - urgency is good. 
- "get started", "easy" - it's an informal phrase that makes the thing you have to do seem less daunting.
