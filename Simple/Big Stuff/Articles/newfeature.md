## New feature release

### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Mildly interested:** "Hm, I'll check this out."| **Moderately interested:** "Huh, that's pretty cool!"|
| **Very interested:** "Yes! New feature from Simple!"| **Satisfied:** "Exactly what I expected. Man I love those guys!"|
| **Uncertain:** "I'm skeptical about whether this is good/useful."| **Confident:** "I can totally see myself using this."|
| **Jaded, hatereading:** "I'm looking for something to criticize about this."| **Pacified:** "Not much to complain about here."|
| **Curious:** "I'm unfamiliar with Simple and this will tell me about them."| **Positive:** "I like this company!"|

### Our copy should focus on:
Our copy should focus on the mildly interested, with things to keep the fanboys happy. That means we can't assume that the reader is intimately familiar with the product. We can assume basic familiarity, but if it's not obtrusive, we should include information for someone learning about Simple for the first time. Balance this with the knowledge that press and others in our industry will be reading this with their purposes in mind.

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
- **Excitement:** We're really into this thing we just built. We're passionate about our product.
- **Ease:** All the copy should indicate that this is an intuitive product. Don't post step-by-step directions on how to use a feature.
- **Momentum:** We're just going to keep building things!
- **That we're nice people:** We love building Simple, and we want it to show in our work.

### Important words or phrases to use:
- "banking" "finance" "money"- you should probably try to say "banking" or the like once or twice.


### **Example Copy**
> "Human brains are kind of lazy. When managing money is a chore, we’re less likely to save, even when we know it’s important. Goals makes saving fun and easy, helping you put more money towards the things that matter to you. Since we announced Goals two years ago, Simple customers have saved for everything from iPhones to first homes.

>Ready to get started with Goals? Here’s what we’ve done to make taking control of your finances even easier."
