## Waiting for decision page

### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Confusion:** "Why am I on this page?"| **Informed:** "We're not done processing your application."|
| **Impatience, uncertainty, unease, eagerness:** "Why isn't my application ready yet?"| **Calm:** "Work is happening."|

### Our copy should focus on:
Conveying the waiting status in a neutral tone.

#### Stuff to remember:
- At this point the customer could still fail IDV. Best not to be too excited on this page.
- There's not much that the customer can do at this point. If you can think of something they can do with the product, suggest it. Otherwise, don't imply that there's something we can do to change, expedite, or alter this process. That is, don't be too open and helpful.

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
- **We are in control of this process:** We don't want them to feel uneasy or mistrustful. We got this.
- **Informed:** Set expectations for how long they might have to wait and what might come next.

### Important words or phrases to use:
- "Thanks!" - we're glad they applied
- Specific information - sets expectations about how this process could go.

### **Example Copy**
