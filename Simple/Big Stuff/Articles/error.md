### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Disrupted:** "Hey I was doing something!"| **Informed but not derailed:** "Oh, that's helpful."|
| **Confused:** "What did I do wrong?"| **Corrected:** "Ah, I see what I should have done."|

### Our copy should focus on:
Somewhere in between the two-- brief, to-the-point, straightforward, informative.

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
- **Informed:** Tell them just the facts.
- **Reassuring:** Don't worry, you're not a failure, here's what you should have done...

### Important words or phrases to use:
**To switch it up a bit, here are some words you *shouldn't* use.**
- "ALERT" - or anything emotional, judgy, or in-all-caps.
- "failure" - the customer didn't fail, and neither did we. We can word this differently.
- "did you mean to..." - don't be condescending. They're not dumb, they just made a mistake.

**Instead, try:**
- "Whoops!" - Informal and not judgy
- Above all, tell them what they need to do/correct.

### **Example Copy**
> "Whoops! We didn't find any transactions by that name."

> "Hm, there doesn't seem to be anything like that here. Try again?"
