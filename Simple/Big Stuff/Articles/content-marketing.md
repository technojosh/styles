## Content marketing blog post

### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Interested because of subject:** "I like this topic."| **Satisfied, informed, enlightened:** "That was cool and I learned something new."|
| **Interested because of Simple:** "I like Simple, so I'm interested in their take."| **Enlightened, loyal:** "I learned something and I like Simple even more now."|

### Our copy should focus on:
Sometimes, the focus is on writing an interesting piece of content for a wide variety of audiences, so both above interests should be considered equally. Sometimes, the focus is on writing content that's geared for a specific audience (e.g. freelancers, couples living together, single moms). In that case the content should obviously be targeted for that group, but if someone else were to read it, they shouldn't be bored or in over their heads.

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
- **Confidence:** We have interesting things to say about this topic and you should listen to us!
- **Informed:** We've done our homework and can speak authoritatively.
- **Interested:** *We* think this topic is cool, so you should too.
- **Personable:** Our personality should shine through in all the work we do.

### Important words or phrases to use:
- (dependent on topic)

### **Example Copy**
>"Stashing [money] makes a lot of emotional sense. It’s what we’ve been told to do since we were little kids. But unless you have a LOT of money to put away indefinitely, being a savvy Stasher involves trade-offs. You would have to stash more than $90,000 in a high yield savings account with 0.80% APY to earn as much in interest in a year as you would save by putting $2 per day towards a Goal using Simple."
