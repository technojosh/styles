## Social media - Request for feedback

### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Characteristic 21st century ennui of the mind and soul:** "I am scrolling through my social media feed."| **Aware:** "I've noticed this post by Simple and I'd like to engage with it."|
| **Fanboyish:** "Woo! Simple wants my feedback!"| **Heard:** "I feel like I was listened to."|
| **Shoulder-chipped:** "Ugh, Simple. I'm already mad at them for something unrelated (or possibly related)."| **Disarmed:** "This is probably not the appropriate place to vent my ire."|

### Our copy should focus on:
When we're asking our social media audiences to engage with us, we should assume we're talking to people who are at least mildly interested in giving their opinion.

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
- **Openness:** We really, *genuinely* want to hear their feedback. We are listening.
- **Specificity:** Right now, we want their feedback on this one specific topic, not us as a company, not another Simple-related topic.
- **Activation:** We are going to do something with the feedback they give us.

### Important words or phrases to use:
- "We" - Reminds people that humans are asking this question (as well as answering).
- "We'd love", "we'd be grateful", etc. - they're helping us out by doing this
- "Thank you!" - We're thankful, maybe effusively so, that they're taking the time to let us know their opinions.

#### Things to remember:
If you're asking a question, you'd better be listening--have someone manning the social medias as soon as you post, so you can answer right away and participate in the conversation. Any social media post will bring people out of the woodwork. You *will* get unrelated questions and comments. Respond to those, but prioritize the on-topic people.

**Facebook**
>How'd you feel about the most recent updates to Goals? We'd love to know if your use of Goals has changed since we added the new features. Thanks!

**Twitter**
>We updated Goals recently--did you notice? Has your use of Goals changed since then? Let us know!

**G+**
>*usually the same as Facebook for things like this*
