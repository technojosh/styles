# Product Styleguide

## Voice 
We design our product to be visually prescriptive--if we've done our job well, hopefully the customer will be able to easily intuit what to do. That means most copy should be there to clarify. 

### Explainers
Since this is banking, there's lots of stuff that needs explaining. The text you write for explainers and tooltips should be short, personable, and helpful.
