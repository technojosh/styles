# The Elements of Simple Style

*In general*, if a rule doesn't exist, make one up. Keep it consistent, and choose the simplest rule that will fit your needs. Look to established style guides for reference.

We're fairly styleguide agnostic here. If you have a question, see what [Strunk and White](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style) have to say on the matter. If they don't know, check out [The Economist's excellent Style Guide](http://www.economist.com/styleguide/introduction). The [Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html) is also online. There are more style and grammar guides [here](http://www.libraryspot.com/grammarstyle.htm).

Don't be burdened by choice, though! Your main criteria for making style and grammar decisions should be (in rough order of importance):

- What offers the most **clarity**?
- What is the **simplest** way of expressing this?
- What is the most **inclusive** of all readers?
- What allows the **friendliest** phrasing and grammar?
- What is the most appropriate for **modern, technology-focused** writing?

# Styleguide glossary

## Abbrevs

<b>Etc.</b>- use sparingly. When creating precise language about financial matters, it’s beneficial to the customer and the company (for ass-covering purposes), to enumerate whenever possible. List all the elements of a list unless some are unknown or a reasonable person would understand what the rest of the list entails. If you do need to use it, use “etc.” instead of “et c.” because the latter is kinda pretentious even if it’s more correct.

<b>Latin abbreviations</b>. Since they usually belong in [parentheses](https://github.banksimple.com/BankSimple/howtowrite/blob/master/Nitty-Gritty/strunkyfresh.md#parenthesis), Latin abbreviations should be used fairly sparingly as well. Here’s a quick primer on what they’re for.

- i.e. = “id est”–“that is [to say]”. Use “i.e.” when you’re clarifying a point or defining your previous phrase.
>You really shouldn’t ever try to scale a building without restraints unless it’s very very important (i.e., you are or someone else is in danger of dying).

- e.g. = “exempli gratia”–“for example”. Use “e.g.” when you’re giving an example. 
>The only birds allowed on the grounds are fowl that could be slaughtered for meat (e.g. geese, ducks, chickens).

## Commas

<b>Oxford Comma</b>. It’s kind of like [toilet paper direction](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/17/toilet-paper-actually-goes-over_n_6887724.html): there are a few sick fucks out there who actually <i>prefer</i> their toilet paper to come off the back of the roll. Okay, I’m joking, but use the Oxford Comma (or Serial Comma). The simple reason is that sometimes there can be ambiguity without it, and it’s best to be consistent. There are several sets of sub-rules when omitting the serial comma, and always including it is a much simpler way of doing things.

Consider Teresa Nielsen Hayden’s example of a book dedication:

>“To my parents, Ayn Rand and God.”

A serial comma also creates a more pleasant flow of words for the reader. Commas indicate short pauses in speech, and readers also “hear” these pauses when they read. 

>“red, white, and blue” is read as “red [pause] white [pause] and blue,” 
>
>“red, white and blue” is read as “red [pause] whiteandblue.”

## Contractions

Yes to <b>contractions</b>! Contractions add informality without adding falseness. Consider “We think you will love using Simple.” vs. “We think you’ll love using Simple.”

## Parenthesis

Okay for blog posts, usually not great for website copy or anything one-paragraph-length or shorter. Parenthetical statements in marketing copy are usually a dead giveaway that language could be simplified. 

There's a notable exception here: when discussing less marketing-y matters, for example when describing the product’s limitations or a user’s rights, feel free to use parenthetical statements to clarify ideas. 

## Personal pronouns

<b>Use "they/them" instead of "he or she"</b>, in sentences like “Everyone has his or her own favorite to-do app.” or “If anyone asks whether he or she can join in, the answer is no.” While grammatically a bit more correct, "his or her" limits you to two genders. Until English thinks of a better third person singular pronoun, we're gonna go with "they/them/their", because ultimately being inclusive is more important than being marginally more grammatically correct. If anyone gets mad at you, tell them (see what I did there?) that [Shakespeare did it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they#Usage).

>*"If someone gets in your grill, tell them they can come at me instead."*

## Quotes

When quoting someone in writing, you should feel free to clean up their language slightly, as long as it doesn't alter the meaning. [Here](http://ajrarchive.org/article.asp?id=1340)'s an interesting list of journalists' views on the subject of cleaning up quptes. If you think the interview subject's diction or manner of speech makes a difference to the piece, you might not want to change it. However, if you interview someone, and their speech is peppered with "like"s and "gonna"s and "um"s that just cloud their meaning, by all means, take them out. This is ultimately up to you as the writer.

## Sign in

When someone enters their username and passphrase to Simple, they are **signing in**. They are not logging in, logging on, signing on, etc. There's no reason "sign in" is superior, other than we need to stay consistent. Remember this stuff too:

- sign into Simple (not "sign in to Simple")
- the sign-in screen/upon sign-in (the noun form is "sign-in")
- the Sign In page (it's the title of the page)

## "Simple"

In general, try not to use the word "simple" or its derivatives (i.e., simply, simplify, simplicity) to describe anything other than the name of our company. Especially don't use it to describe some part of the product, or the company. It can sound schlocky and marketing-y when you don't mean to, and it also dilutes or trademark. Maybe? Try: plain, easy, straightforward, uncomplicated.

## Subject lines

Email subject lines look friendlier if they're not in title case. Capitalize the first word and any proper nouns. If the subject is a sentence, punctuate it as such. 

Like:
>Subject: *Hey! Thanks for becoming a Simple customer!*

or:

>Subject: *Your application*

## Tech words

<b>Email</b>. A format that’s arguably the most important communications method of our age is also its own thing. It’s no longer “electronic mail” or "E-Mail"; it’s ascended. Email. That’s the word. (Allen Goodman made me put this in here.)

## Titles

*(See also: Subject lines)*

**Title Case** should be used for the titles of blog posts, web pages, etc. *Title Case* means the antiquated titling style you learned in Middle School-- first and last words capitalized, plus all the "important" words within. Unimportant words are usually words like a, the, for, but, in, to, of, etc. Sometimes, depending on context, though, these words can be important words.

Like:
> *The Title of This Blog Post Makes You Want to Read It.*

When in doubt, capitalize.

**Sub-headings** should not be in title case. Use normal punctuation, and if it's a sentence or sentence-ish fragment, punctuate it as such.

Like:
> *This sub-heading is not a title, it's for readability.*
